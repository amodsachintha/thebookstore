For one brother it means a desperate flight, and a search for the one - maybe two - people who could clear his name. For his brother it means a life lived under constant threat of treachery and murder. And for their sister, even without knowing the full truth, it means returning to a place she\'d thought abandoned forever. Only the sister is not what she once was; Djan Seriy Anaplian has changed almost beyond recognition to become an agent of the Culture\'s Special Circumstances section, charged with high-level interference in civilisations throughout the greater galaxy. Concealing her new identity - and her particular set of abilities - might be a dangerous strategy, however. In the world to which Anaplian returns, nothing is quite as it seems; and determining the appropriate level of interference in someone else\'s war is never a simple matter.

A man on the curb handed him an envelope whose contents stunned U.S. intelligence: details of top-secret Soviet research and developments in military technology that were totally unknown to the United States. In the years that followed, the man, Adolf Tolkachev, an engineer in a Soviet military design bureau, used his high-level access to hand over tens of thousands of pages of technical secrets. His revelations allowed America to reshape its weapons systems to defeat Soviet radar on the ground and in the air, giving the United States near total superiority in the skies over Europe.\r\nOne of the most valuable spies to work for the United States in the four decades of global confrontation with the Soviet Union, Tolkachev took enormous personal risksâ€”but so did the Americans. The CIA had long struggled to recruit and run agents in Moscow, and Tolkachev was a singular breakthrough. Using spy cameras and secret codes as well as face-to-face meetings in parks and on street corners, Tolkachev and his handlers succeeded for years in eluding the feared KGB in its own backyard, until the day came when a shocking betrayal put them all at risk. \r\nDrawing on previously secret documents obtained from the CIA and on interviews with participants, David Hoffman has created an unprecedented and poignant portrait of Tolkachev, a man motivated by the depredations of the Soviet state to master the craft of spying against his own country. Stirring, unpredictable, and at times unbearably tense, The Billion Dollar Spy is a brilliant feat of reporting that unfolds like an espionage thriller.','espionage politics cold war russia kgb KGB NSA FBI crime','The Billion Dollar Spy_ A True - David E.

By the time of Sagan\'s death in 1996, the series had been seen by half a billion people; Sagan was perhaps the best-known scientist on the planet. Explaining how the series came about, Sagan recalled:\r\n\r\nI was positive from my own experience that an enormous global interest exists in the exploration of the planets and in many kindred scientific topics--the origin of life, the Earth, and the Cosmos, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, our connection with the universe. And I was certain that this interest could be excited through that most powerful communications medium, television.\r\n\r\nSagan\'s own interest and enthusiasm for the universe were so vivid and infectious, his screen presence so engaging, that viewers and readers couldn\'t help but be caught up in his vision. From stars in their \"billions and billions\" to the amino acids in the primordial ocean, Sagan communicated a feeling for science as a process of discovery.

In Kingpin, he pours his unmatched access and expertise into book form for the first time, delivering a gripping cat-and-mouse narrative-and an unprecedented view into the twenty-first century\'s signature form of organized crime. The word spread through the hacking underground like some unstoppable new virus: Someone-some brilliant, audacious crook-had just staged a hostile takeover of an online criminal network that siphoned billions of dollars from the US economy. The FBI rushed to launch an ambitious undercover operation aimed at tracking down this new kingpin; other agencies around the world deployed dozens of moles and double agents. Together, the cybercops lured numerous unsuspecting hackers into their clutches. . . . Yet at every turn, their main quarry displayed an uncanny ability to sniff out their snitches and see through their plots. The culprit they sought was the most unlikely of criminals: a brilliant programmer with a hippie ethic and a supervillain\'s double identity. As prominent white-hat hacker Max Vision Butler, he was a celebrity throughout the programming world, even serving as a consultant to the FBI. But as the black-hat Iceman, he found in the world of data theft an irresistible opportunity to test his outsized abilities. He infiltrated thousands of computers around the country, sucking down millions of credit card numbers at will. He effortlessly hacked his fellow hackers, stealing their ill-gotten gains from under their noses. Together with a smooth-talking con artist, he ran a massive real-world crime ring. And for years, he did it all with seeming impunity, even as countless rivals ran afoul of police. Yet as he watched the fraudsters around him squabble, their ranks riddled with infiltrators, their methods inefficient, he began to see in their dysfunction the ultimate challenge: He would stage his coup and fix what was broken, run things as they should be run-even if it meant painting a bull\'s-eye on his forehead. Through the story of this criminal\'s remarkable rise, and of law enforcement\'s quest to track him down, Kingpin lays bare the workings of a silent crime wave still affecting millions of Americans. In these pages, we are ushered into vast online-fraud supermarkets stocked with credit card numbers, counterfeit checks, hacked bank accounts, dead drops, and fake passports. We learn the workings of the numerous hacks-browser exploits, phishing attacks, Trojan horses, and much more-these fraudsters use to ply their trade, and trace the complex routes by which they turn stolen data into millions of dollars. And thanks to Poulsen\'s remarkable access to both cops and criminals, we step inside the quiet, desperate arms race that law enforcement continues to fight with these scammers today. Ultimately, Kingpin is a journey into an underworld of startling scope and power, one in which ordinary American teenagers work hand in hand with murderous Russian mobsters and where a simple Wi-Fi connection can unleash a torrent of gold worth millions.

To his scientific colleagues, Richard Feynman was a magician of the highest caliber. Architect of quantum theories, enfant terrible of the atomic bomb project, caustic critic of the space shuttle commission, Nobel Prize winner for work that gave physicists a new way of describing and calculating the interactions of subatomic particles, Richard Feynman left his mark on virtually every area of modern physics. Originality was his obsession. Never content with what he knew or with what others knew, Feynman ceaselessly questioned scientific truths. But there was also another side to him, one which made him a legendary figure among scientists. His curiosity moved well beyond things scientific: he taught himself how to play drums, to give massages, to write Chinese, to crack safes. In Genius, James Gleick, author of the acclaimed best-seller Chaos, shows us a Feynman few have seen. He penetrates beyond the gleeful showman depicted in Feynman\'s own memoirs and reveals a darker Feynman: his ambition, his periods of despair and uncertainty, his intense emotional nature. From his childhood on the beaches and backlots of Far Rockaway and his first tinkering with radios and differential equations to the machine shops at MIT and the early theoretical work at Princeton - work that foreshadowed his famous notion of antiparticles traveling backward in time - to the tragic death of his wife while he was working at Los Alamos, Genius shows how one scientist\'s vision was formed. As that vision crystallized in work that reinvented quantum mechanics, we see Feynman\'s impact on the elite particle-physicscommunity, and how Feynman grew to be at odds with the very community that idolized him. Finally, Gleick explores the nature of genius, our obsession with it and why the very idea may belong to another time. Genius records the life of a scientist who has forever changed science - and changed what it means to know something in this uncertain century.','feynman caltech usa quantum theory ','Genius_ The Life and Science of - James Gleick.mobicover.jpg','Genius_ The Life and Science of - James Gleick.mobi'),(10,'Use of Weapons','9780316030571','Culture',8,'Penguin','2008-11-20',800,'EDITORIAL REVIEW:\r\n\r\nThe man known as Cheradenine Zakalwe was one of Special Circumstances\' foremost agents, changing the destiny of planets to suit the Culture through intrigue, dirty tricks and military action.\r\n\r\nThe woman known as Diziet Sma had plucked him from obscurity and pushed him towards his present eminence, but despite all their dealings she did not know him as well as she thought.\r\n\r\nThe drone known as Skaffen-Amtiskaw knew both of these people.

The cause was a complete mysteryâ€”apparently as much to the technicians replacing the centrifuges as to the inspectors observing them. \r\n\r\nThen, five months later, a seemingly unrelated event occurred: A computer security firm in Belarus was called in to troubleshoot some computers in Iran that were crashing and rebooting repeatedly.\r\n\r\n At first, the firmâ€™s programmers believed the malicious code on the machines was a simple, routine piece of malware. But as they and other experts around the world investigated, they discovered a mysterious virus of unparalleled complexity. \r\n\r\nThey had, they soon learned, stumbled upon the worldâ€™s first digital weapon. For Stuxnet, as it came to be known, was unlike any other virus or worm built before: Rather than simply hijacking targeted computers or stealing information from them, it escaped the digital realm to wreak actual, physical destruction on a nuclear facility.  \r\n\r\nIn these pages, Wired journalist Kim Zetter draws on her extensive sources and expertise to tell the story behind Stuxnetâ€™s planning, execution, and discovery, covering its genesis in the corridors of Bushâ€™s White House and its unleashing on systems in Iranâ€”and telling the spectacular, unlikely tale of the security geeks who managed to unravel a sabotage campaign years in the making. \r\n\r\nBut Countdown to Zero Day ranges far beyond Stuxnet itself. Here, Zetter shows us how digital warfare developed in the US. She takes us inside todayâ€™s flourishing zero-day â€œgrey markets,â€ in which intelligence agencies and militaries pay huge sums for the malicious code they need to carry out infiltrations and attacks. She reveals just how vulnerable many of our own critical systems are to Stuxnet-like strikes, from nation-state adversaries and anonymous hackers alikeâ€”and shows us just what might happen should our infrastructure be targeted by such an attack. \r\n\r\nPropelled by Zetterâ€™s unique knowledge and access, and filled with eye-opening explanations of the technologies involved, Countdown to Zero Day is a comprehensive and prescient portrait of a world at the edge of a new kind of war.','espionage politics virus computer USA Iran nuclear','Countdown to Zero Day_ Stuxnet - Kim Zetter.mobicover.jpg','Countdown to Zero Day_ Stuxnet - Kim Zetter.mobi'),(12,'Surface Detail','B00462RVHI','Culture',8,'Little Brown','2010-07-25',600,'It begins in the realm of the Real, where matter still matters.

Thomas Professor of Education, Harvard Graduate School of Education</b>\r\nâ€œSimon Baron-Cohen displays once again his ability to bring science to bear on troubling and controversial issues. Arguing that we explain nothing by describing acts of wanton cruelty as evil, he explores the simple but powerful hypothesis that such acts can be traced to a distinct psychological state - a lack of empathy. He backs up his claim with a wealth of research - from developmental psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience and genetics. Those who have to deal with the aftermath of cruelty may not agree with Baron-Cohenâ€™s analysis but they will surely be informed and provoked by his boldness and originality.â€\r\n\r\nMichael Gazzaniga, Professor of Psychology, University of California - Santa Barbara; author of *The Ethical Brain\r\n*â€œHorrific crimes usually freeze the mind, leaving only a desire for retribution. Simon Baron-Cohen has taken us beyond those mental inadequacies. In this book, proposing a new way to think about evil people and empathy, he has laid the scientific groundwork for a future and brighter science of understanding the dark side of the human condition.â€\r\n\r\nMarco Iacoboni, Professor, UCLA; author of *Mirroring People: The Science of Empathy and How We Connect with Others\r\nâ€œThe Science of Evil* is a compelling journey into the ubiquitous power of empathy in our lives.

Both disturbing and compassionate this brilliant book establishes a new science of evil, explaining both its brain basis and development.

A twenty-eight year old \' and not widely famous \' Christopher Wren was giving a lecture on astronomy. As his audience listened to him speak, they decided that it would be a good idea to create a Society to promote the accumulation of useful knowledge. With that, the Royal Society was born.Since its birth, the Royal Society has pioneered scientific exploration and discovery. Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, Robert Hooke, Robert Boyle, Joseph Banks, Humphry Davy, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, John Locke, Alexander Fleming \' all were members. Bill Bryson\'s favourite member was Reverend Thomas Bayes, a brilliant mathematician who devised Bayes\' theorem. Whilst it had little practical use in Bayes\' lifetime, today his theorem is used for weather forecasting, astrophysics and stock market analysis. A milestone in mathematical history, it only exists because the Royal Society decided to preserve it \' just in case.The Royal Society continues to do today what it set out to do all those years ago. Its members have split the atom, discovered the double helix, the electron, the computer and the World Wide Web.

Imagine sitting in a room listening to Hawking discuss these achievements and place them in historical context; it would be like hearing Christopher Columbus on the New World.\r\n\r\nHawking presents a series of seven lecturesâ€”covering everything from big bang to black holes to string theoryâ€”that capture not only the brilliance of Hawkingâ€™s mind but his characteristic wit as well. Of his research on black holes, which absorbed him for more than a decade, he says, â€œIt might seem a bit like looking for a black cat in a coal cellar.â€\r\n\r\nHawking begins with a history of ideas about the universe, from Aristotleâ€™s determination that the Earth is round to Hubbleâ€™s discovery, more than 2,000 years later, that the universe is expanding. Using that as a launching pad, he explores the reaches of modern physics, including theories on the origin of the universe (e.g., the Big Bang), the nature of black holes, and space-time. Finally, he poses the questions left unanswered by modern physics, especially how to combine all the partial theories into a â€œunified theory of everything.â€ â€œIf we find the answer to that,â€ he claims, â€œit would be the ultimate triumph of human reason.â€\r\n\r\nA great popularizer of science as well as a brilliant scientist, Hawking believes that advances in theoretical science should be â€œunderstandable in broad principle by everyone, not just a few scientists.â€ In this book, he offers a fascinating voyage of discovery about the cosmos and our place in it.

He approaches his material with a blithe tone that oozes sarcasm and crocodile tears. But the palpable humor of the writing itself endears listeners to him enough that they won\'t be completely repelled by even Burroughs\'s ugliest moments (which include his less than gallant reaction to accidentally stepping on a toddler\'s fingers in a store). His performance is off the cuff, but even when he\'s at his least humane, he still comes across as all too human. He adopts the same openness that made his previous memoirs-dealing with his bizarre upbringing and battle with addiction-so successful; now, however, he\'s focusing on less serious subject matter and displaying failings that are more vain. Burroughs excels in his personifications of others, whether portraying a domineering cleaning woman or an overbearing boss. While some may secretly wish for the death of such a boss, though, Burroughs admits openly and proudly that he believes he can will it to happen. That attitude, which is accentuated by his reading, makes this audiobook a true guilty pleasure. Simultaneous release with the St. Martin\'s hardcover (Forecasts, July 12). (Oct.)

A Game of Thrones Long ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom\' s protective Wall. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the land they were born to. Sweeping from a land of brutal cold to a distant summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, here is a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens. Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most treacherous of journeys. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, the fate of the Starks, their allies, and their enemies hangs perilously in the balance, as each endeavors to win thatdeadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones. \"From the Trade Paperback edition.\"</p>','Fantasy Ice fire tv series ','A Game Of Thrones - George R.

An American Buddhist nun in the lineage of Tibetan master Chogyam Trungpa, she writes that we already have what we need to change and heal. ChÃ¶drÃ¶n focuses on the preverbal momentâ€”called <em>shenpa</em> in Tibetanâ€”in which individuals are hooked into harmful stories, emotions and actions within the flux of their experiences. Clear descriptions of how this process works are accompanied by simple techniques to begin to break the cycle. Her suggestions can be easily practiced by anyone at any time without meditation training, although she presents the benefits of sitting meditation. With anecdotes from her teachers and examples from her own and others\' lives, ChÃ¶drÃ¶n demonstrates that people can stop their suffering and access their natural intelligence, warmth and openness. Throughout, she emphasizes the global implications of personal change. Among her strengths are compassion for the difficulty of human existence and her willingness to acknowledge her own failings.

For nearly the past quarter century, while most Americans were unaware, Afghanistan has been the playing field for intense covert operations by U.S. and foreign intelligence agencies-invisible wars which sowed the seeds of the September 11 attacks and which provide its context. From the Soviet invasion in 1979 through the summer of 2001, the CIA, KGB, Pakistan\'s ISI, and Saudi Arabia\'s General Intelligence Department all operated directly and secretly in Afghanistan. They primed Afghan factions with cash and weapons, secretly trained guerrilla forces, funded propaganda, and manipulated politics. In the midst of these struggles bin Laden conceived and then built his global organization.    Comprehensively and for the first time, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Steve Coll tells the secret history of the CIA\'s role in Afghanistan, from its covert program against Soviet troops from 1979 to 1989, to the rise of the Taliban and the emergence of bin Laden, to the secret efforts by CIA officers and their agents to capture or kill bin Laden in Afghanistan after 1998. Based on extensive firsthand accounts, *Ghost Wars*ok  is the inside story that goes well beyond anything previously published on U.S. involvement in Afghanistan. It chronicles the roles of midlevel CIA officers, their Afghan allies, and top spy masters such as Bill Casey, Saudi Arabia\'s Prince Turki al Faisal, and George Tenet. And it describes heated debates within the American government and the often poisonous, mistrustful relations between the CIA and foreign intelligence agencies.    *Ghost Wars* answers the questions so many have asked since the horrors of September 11: To what extent did America\'s best intelligence analysts grasp the rising threat of Islamist radicalism? Who tried to stop bin Laden and why did they fail?</p></div>','History Intelligence Cold war US Al Qaeda Afganistan CIA KGB  ISI','Ghost Wars - Steve Coll.mobicover.jpg','Ghost Wars - Steve Coll.mobi'),(40,'Double Helix 01: Infection','9780671032555','Star Trek: TNG',8,'Simon and Schuster','1999-05-08',600,'<div><h3>Summary</h3><p>Like the twisted strands of mutant chromosomes, an insidious alien conspiracy winds its way through the entire Alpha Quadrant, just as it stretches across several years of Starfleet history -- beginning near the very start of Captain Picard\'s command of the <em>Starship Enterpriseâ„¢!</em></p><p>It is only the first year of the <em>U.S.S.

A radical political group called the Purity League claims the plague is an act of God against \'blasphemous unnatural unions.\'\" </p><p>Riker gave him a blank stare. \"Sir?\" </p><p>Picard cleared his throat. <em>How to phrase this delicately.</em> He said, \"The Purity League is opposed to interspecies mating -- \'mixers\' as they call such people.\" </p><p>Again the rumble of the ship\'s engines filled the room. <em>They can\'t believe it, either,</em> he thought. <em>Humanity is supposed to be beyond such prejudices.</em></p><p>He noticed that Deanna Troi, half human and half Betazoid herself, hid her inner feelings behind a mask of professional calm. He would have given a lot to know her true reaction. Undoubtedly she was even more shocked and horrified than he had been. </p><p><em>To think that some humans are still capable of such petty resentments...</em></p><p>He forced himself back to the problem at hand. \"Mixers -- or anyone else suspected of adulterating the purity of the human race -- are treated as second-class citizens in many places on Archaria III,\" he continued. \"Officially such prejudices are prohibited, of course, but in the backwater towns discrimination apparently still runs rampant. Only in the half-dozen large cities do humans and Peladians work and live together with something approaching harmony. In the country, things have apparently become so bad that most full-blooded Peladians now live in isolated enclaves surrounded by their own kind.\" </p><p>Riker said, \"That sounds like a ghetto system.\" </p><p>\"It is. Those of mixed heritage are even less fortunate, since they belong fully to neither the human nor the Peladian world. They were relocating to the cities in record numbers -- until the plague struck. Now they\'re fleeing into the countryside once more, living like vagabonds in tent camps.\" Picard looked down at his clenched, interlaced fingers resting uneasily on the table. He didn\'t bother to feign relaxation. Sometimes it was good for the crew to see him share their anger. </p><p>Deanna Troi asked, \"How many people of mixed blood are on the planet?\" </p><p>\"Nobody is quite sure. Estimates range from between 150,000 and 200,000 people. Obviously, those mixers who most closely resemble humans hide the truth to avoid conflict with the Purity League.\" </p><p>Data said, \"I am aware of the Purity League, sir. The Federation has monitored their activities for many years, but has deemed them a minor nuisance with little actual influence.\" </p><p>\"Their influence is growing,\" Picard said firmly. The private reports he had read gave alarming statistics; according to confidential surveys, fully half of the planet\'s human population harbored feelings of support for the Purity League, though the League\'s actual membership numbers were open to conjecture. It was certainly in the tens of thousands if not the hundreds of thousands. </p><p>He went on. \"The Purity League\'s leader, Father Veritas, is using the plague as a rallying point for anti-alien sentiment. Apparently Veritas is responsible for inciting dozens of race riots in the last few months. The whole planet is in turmoil. The nonhuman population -- and especially the partly human population -- is running scared. The plague\'s growth has only served to make the situation worse.\" <em>\"Veritas,\" indeed,</em> he thought, grimacing. <em>If ever there was a misnomer...</em></p><p>\"Sir,\" said Deanna Troi, \"Archaria III has a long history of interspecies problems, including wars, assassinations, and racism. Its history is part of several planetary evolution courses at the Academy. I believe everyone here has studied it to some degree.\" </p><p>A general murmur of agreement came from the rest of his senior staff. Picard found himself surprised -- it hadn\'t been part of the curriculum when he had studied at the Academy -- but he was pleased. <em>They\'re keeping up with the times.</em></p><p>\"That is correct, sir,\" said Data. \"It was settled in 2102 by a human sect of religious fundamentalists called the Brotherhood. Seven years later, these human settlers encountered Peladian settlers, who had colonized the planet almost simultaneously.\" </p><p>Picard had never seen a Peladian and knew little about them, beyond the fact that they were humanoid, militant about privacy, and generally considered pacifists...except when provoked. </p><p>Data went on, \"After a series of small wars, as the two sides got to know each other, peaceful relations and coexistence began. According to the information I have accessed, with the increasing agricultural importance of Archaria III their differences were largely put aside, in favor of economic cooperation.\" </p><p>\"That is the public story,\" Picard said. He folded his arms and frowned a bit. \"There have always been tensions.

He is well known for having created the character Conan the Cimmerian, a literary icon whose pop-culture imprint can be compared to such icons as Tarzan of the Apes, Sherlock Holmes, and James Bond. Voracious reading, along with a natural talent for prose writing and the encouragement of teachers, conspired to create in Howard an interest in becoming a professional writer. One by one he discovered the authors that would influence his later work: Jack London and Rudyard Kipling. It\'s clear from Howard\'s earliest writings and the recollections of his friends that he suffered from severe depression from an early age. Friends recall him defending the act of suicide as a valid alternative as early as eighteen years old, while many of his stories and poems have a suicidal gloom and intensity that seem prescient in hindsight, describing such an end not as a tragedy but as a release from hell on earth.</p></div>','Pulp Adventure, ','The Iron Man - Robert E.

Stoker-winner Clegg (_The Hour Before Dark_) has an uncanny ability to frighten readers by chronicling everyday characters\' perilous descents into their own private hells. Julie Hutchinson mentally unravels after the brutal and mysterious murder of her husband, Jeff, in this stand-alone tale full of subtle suspense, inventive twists and credible characters. Julie has erotic nightmares and hideous hallucinations while slowly trying to piece together the decades-old puzzle involving her husband\'s past work with Project Daylight, a now-defunct privately funded school that conducted experiments on young children with ESP. Eventually, with the assistance of her mother, daughter and stepson, as well as Jeff\'s ex-wife and Michael Diamond, a popular TV psychic, Julie unearths bizarre secrets about her family that lead her to an underground society of scientific misfits. The book\'s final sentence is guaranteed to unnerve readers and leave them wanting more.

It is the only Islamic state to have nuclear weapons. Its border with Afghanistan extends over one thousand miles and is the likely hideout of Osama bin Laden. It has been under military dictatorship for thirty-three of its fiftyyear existence. Yet it is the linchpin in the United States\' war on terror, receiving over $10 billion of American aid since 2001 and purchasing more than $5 billion of U.S. weaponry in 2006 alone.These days, relations between the two countries are never less than tense. Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf reported that U.S. deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage threatened to \"bomb Pakistan back to the Stone Age\" if it did not commit fully to the alliance in the wake of 9/11. Presidential hopeful Barack Obama said he would have no hesitation in bombing Al Qaeda inside the country, \"with or without\" approval of the Pakistani government. Recent surveys show that more than 70 percent of Pakistanis fear the United States as a military threat to their country.The Bush administration spent much of 2007 promoting a \"dream ticket\" of Musharraf and Benazir Bhutto to run Pakistan together. That strategy, with Bhutto assassinated and the general\'s party winning less than 15 percent of the contested seats in the 2008 election, is now in tatters.With increasingly bold attacks by Taliban supporters in the border regions threatening to split the Pakistan army, with the only political alternatives -- Nawaz Sharif and Benazir\'s widower Asif Ali Zardari -- being as corrupt as the regime they seek to replace, and with a newly radicalized movement of lawyers testing its strength as championsof the rule of law, the chances of sustained stability in Pakistan look slim. The scion of a famous Punjabi political family, with extraordinary contacts inside the country and internationally, Tariq Ali has long been acknowledged as a leading commentator on Pakistan. In these pages he combines deep understanding of the country\'s history with extensive firsthand research and unsparing political judgment to weigh the prospects of those contending for power today. The labyrinthine path between a secure world and global conflagration runs right through Pakistan. No one is better placed to trace its contours.</p>','Politics america usa pakistan power islam bomb espionage','The duel_ Pakistan on the flight path of - Tariq Ali.mobicover.jpg','The duel_ Pakistan on the flight path of - Tariq Ali.mobi'),(50,'The Obamas: The Untold Story of an African Family','9781848092723','',19,'Preface Publishing','2010-06-12',650,'<div><h3>Reviews</h3><p><em>Starred Review</em> The most famous family in Kenyaâ€”and, indeed, the worldâ€”provides the context for exploring the broader history of that nation as documentary filmmaker Firstbrook explores the Obama family legacy. He draws on academic historical research as well as oral history and interviews to trace Barack Obamaâ€™s family history back 23 generations. Part of the Luo, the second largest tribe in Kenya (following the Kikuyu), the Obama family traversed through several ancestral lands before religion (some were Seventh-Day Adventists, and others were Muslims) and distance separated them into the towns of Kendu Bay and Kâ€™ogelo. He highlights Obamaâ€™s paternal grandfather, Onyango, who traveled beyond the ancestral lands, prospered, fought in two world wars, and witnessed bloody revolt against British colonialism as well as Kenyan independence. His son, Barack, similarly restless and ambitious, was educated in Hawaii (where he met President Obamaâ€™s mother) and the continental U.S. before returning home to continue straddling tribal tradition and the demands of modern Western culture. Obama senior was critical of the government and friendly with Tom Mboya, an activist, who was killed during the Jomo Kenyatta administration, adding to suspicion later when Obama was killed in a car accident. Enhanced with maps and photographs, this is an epic look at the history of a nation and a family. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: The story of Barack Obamaâ€™s Kenyan roots, this title is the product of dozens of interviews with Obamaâ€™s African relatives, presented by the first person to trace Obamaâ€™s family history back 400 years and 23 generations. --Vanessa Bush </p><h3>Product Description</h3><p>On January 20, 2009, a few hundred men, women, and children gathered under trees in the twilight at Kâ€™obama, a village on the shores of Lake Victoria in western Kenya. Barack Obamaâ€™s rise to the American presidency had captivated people around the world, but members of this gathering took a special pride in the swearing in of Americaâ€™s first black president, for they were all Obamas, all the presidentâ€™s direct African family.   </p><p>In the first in-depth history of the Obama family, Peter Firstbrook recounts a journey that starts in a mud hut by the White Nile and ends seven centuries later in the White House. Interweaving oral history and tribal lore, interviews with Obama family members and other Kenyans, the writings of Kenyan historians, and original genealogical research, Firstbrook sets the fascinating story of the presidentâ€™s family against the background of Kenyaâ€™s rich culture and complex history.  </p><p>He tells the story of farmers and fishermen, of healers and hunters, of families lost and found, establishing for the first time the early ancestry of the Obamas. From the tribeâ€™s cradleland in southern Sudan, he follows the family generation by generation, tracing the paths of the famous Luo warriorsâ€”Obamaâ€™s direct ancestorsâ€”and vividly illuminating Luo politics, society, and traditions.  </p><p>Firstbrook also brings to life the impact of English colonization in Africa through the eyes of President Obamaâ€™s grandfather Onyango. An ambitious and disciplined man who fought in two world wars, witnessed the bloody Mau Mau insurrection, and saw his country gain independence from white rule, Onyango was also hot-tempered and autocratic: family lore has it that President Obamaâ€™s grandmother abandoned the family after Onyango attempted to murder her. And Firstbrook delves into the troubled life of Obamaâ€™s father, a promising young man whose aspirations were stymied by post-independence tribal politics and a rash tendency toward self-destructionâ€”two factors that his family believes contributed to his death in 1982. They say it was no accident, as described in the presidentâ€™s memoirs, but rather a politically motivated hit job.  </p><p>More than a tale of love and war, hardship and hard-won success, <em>The Obamas</em> reveals a family historyâ€”epic in scope yet intimate in feelâ€”that is truly without precedent. </p>\r\n\r\n</div>','Autobiography, Politics president potus america us election','The Obamas_ The Untold Story of an African Family - Peter Firstbrook.mobicover.jpg','The Obamas_ The Untold Story of an African Family - Peter Firstbrook.mobi');
